## 1. GPA Data

```{r pair plot}
# read in GPA data
gpa_data <- read_csv("../data/gpa_data.csv")

# pair plot
gpa_data %>% ggpairs(progress = FALSE)
```

We are going to try and model `univ_gpa` with the predictors `high_gpa`, `math_sat` and `verb_sat`, represented by the following linear equation:
$$
univ\_gpa_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 high\_gpa_i+ \beta_2 math\_sat_i+ \beta_3 verb\_sat_i+ \varepsilon_i
$$

Lets try to fit the linear model

```{r model_fitting}
model_MLR <- lm(univ_gpa~math_sat + verb_sat + high_gpa, data = gpa_data)

tidy(model_MLR)
```

It seems that only the `high_gpa` is statistically significant and the rest are not.
